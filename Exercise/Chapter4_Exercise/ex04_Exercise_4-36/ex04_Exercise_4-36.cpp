//
// (World Population Growth) World population has grown considerably over the centuries.
// Continued growth could eventually challenge the limits of breathable air, drinkable water, 
// arable cropland and other limited resources. There is evidence that growth has been slowing 
// in recent years and that world population could peak some time this century, then start 
// to decline. 
// 
// For this exercise, research world population growth issues online. Be sure to investigate 
// various viewpoints. Get estimates for the current world population and its growth rate 
// (the percentage by which it is likely to increase this year). Write a program that calculates 
// world population growth each year for the next 75 years, using the simplifying assumption 
// that the current growth rate will stay constant. Print the results in a table. The first 
// column should display the year from year 1 to year 75. The second column should display 
// the anticipated world population at the end of that year. The third column should display 
// the numerical increase in the world population that would occur that year. Using your results, 
// determine the year in which the population would be double what it is today, if this yearâ€™s 
// growth rate were to persist.
//
// The measurement of growth is measure by a steady rate each year up to 50 years.
// For example 2% per year will be 2% up to 50 years.  And then the percentage
// will be evaluated again.
